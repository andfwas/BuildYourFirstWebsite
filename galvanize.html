              <p>I learned basic html as a freshman in college from a friend and built a few personal sites that were ugly but I enjoyed the process of building them.</p>
              <p>Fast forward 18 years to 2013... I saw the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn">Codecademy</a> creators on tv explaining that anyone can learn to code and even kids are learning it these days. Kids are even building incredible applications! Attracted by the  <em>free</em> aspect of <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn">Codecademy</a>, I took the html and css courses and was surprised that I actually remembered html, and css seemed to come easily.</p>
              <p>The next suggested course was Javascript which I tried and became quickly confused and discouraged. I decided to quit at that point.</p>
              <p>Fast forward another 3.5 years... I revisited <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn">Codecademy</a> and was surprised to learn that Javascript was no longer "too hard!"</p>
              <p>At that point I developed a love and dare I call it an <em>addiction</em> to object oriented programming languages in general. I quickly devoured every available free online course I could get my hands on.</p>
              <p>At this point I still considered my obsession a hobby. It wasn't until I quit my most recent job that I was forced to consider web development as a career option. My previous job (and most jobs I have ever had) was intense work for very little pay. After my yearly review, they gave me a very nice title and all the responsibility that went with it without appropriate compensation. It was then that I realized I wasn't actualizing my potential. I also realized I would have to apply myself to learning some new and more specific skills in order to actualize my potential. I have always loved computers and I have been building my own PCs for myself, as well as for my family and friends for over 10 years. I thought, "I'm a frickin computer guy! Let's do something with computers!!"</p>
              <p>I have had people tell me that I am "brave" for embarking on a career change at my age. My answer to that is "I think the bravery was in trying to make the previous methods work for <em>SO LONG</em>..." Which is why I am <em>RELIEVED</em> to finally be here!</p>
